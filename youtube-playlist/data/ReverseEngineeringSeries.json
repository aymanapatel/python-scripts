                "description": "This is a new series that I started where I use a popular app try to reverse engineer the user experience. Making guesses on how it was written and what technologies might have been used. \n\nIn this episode I am on a flight back to los Angeles, I turn on flight mode and open Instagram and start working with the app and commenting on its behavior. Very interesting video I enjoyed making it. The app didn’t crash at all, the user experience remain solid. We discuss the trade offs the developer makes to make sure the user experience is optimal and performance is met. \n\nEnjoy guys let me know what you think about this thanks. \n\nSorry about vertical first video screening from phone. Will do better next time. \n\n\nStay awesome\nHussein",

                "description": "This is our #reverseengineering series where we pick a mainstream app and try to understand how the developers built it, how the APIs are designed on the backend and how the front-end user experience is designed for performance, efficiency and business decisions. We can become better software engineers by learning how the likes of Google, Facebook, and Twitter are building APIs and user experiences. Obviously, I might make a mistake here and there but that is part of the fun!\n\nIn this episode, we try to reverse engineer the YouTube watch page and its the video streaming API in particular. We discuss how the IOS YouTube App is doing efficient thumbnail and video caching. Featured in this video is #EvanCarmichael one of my favorite YouTubers.",
