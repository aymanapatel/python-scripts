== Getting Started

 
=== 1. Installing `discord.py` (Name of Discord library)


```
pip install -U discord.py
```

`discord.py` is a Python library that exhaustively implements Discord’s APIs in an efficient and Pythonic way. This includes utilizing Python’s implementation of **Async IO**.


=== 2. Add token


```
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
DISCORD_TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')
```

`.env`:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord-token>`
